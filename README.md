# flask-templating-project
Simple project to serve up a website using templates

## Purpose
This project's purpose is to serve as a basis and reference for future endeavors in using a template to quickly get a website up and running,
if need be. This is not really meant to be used by another person, but if you happen to want to run this I've provided instructions on how to get
it up and running.

## What Did I Learn?
I learned quite a few things that I initially thought would be difficult but Flask really does make it easier.
- Utilize templates by creating a template directory and moving any .html into it
- Utilize the render_template method from Flask to actually utilize templates
- Serve static files including stylesheets and images

### How to setup?
1. Install the Flask dependency located at the top. In PyCharm, it's as simple as hovering over 
>flask

then clicking 
>install package

2. Run server.py
3. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/
